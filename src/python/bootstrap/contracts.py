# Annotations as contracts, with the semantics of Findler and Felleisen's
# λCON ("Contracts for Higher-Order Functions", ICFP 2002) and Racket's
# first-order checks on functions. docs/contracts.md has the design.
#
# A definition's annotations are its contract, and every reference to a
# contracted function is an obligation between two parties: the definition
# itself, and the definition the reference is in. A flat contract is checked
# when its value crosses. A function contract is checked first-order when the
# function crosses, and in full at each application: the argument with the
# parties swapped, the result as they are. A failed check blames the party
# that, by those rules, gave the value. compile.py puts the obligations into
# a program, and explain/typeCheck.py words a broken one.

      higher-order (`higher_order`), and `path` gives the way down.
    - `actual` and `value` are what the value was, and `expected` the types
      that would have been accepted where it failed.
    - `blamed` is the party that broke it: the definition (`role` "owner")
