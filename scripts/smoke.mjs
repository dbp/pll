/**
 * The smoke suite, run in parallel: every test file, each section of the
 * tests made of sections, and the golden corpus in shards, as separate
 * processes - as many at once as the cores carry. Each test makes its own
 * temporary files and servers (on port 0), so running them together checks
 * exactly what running them one at a time does.
 *
 * Jobs that depend on real time - a Stop's latency, a reactor's ticks, a
 * Ctrl+C sent at a moment - run afterwards, in a second phase with the
 * machine otherwise idle, so that load cannot move their timing.
 *
 *   node scripts/smoke.mjs             everything (after `pnpm run build`)
 *   node scripts/smoke.mjs cli golden  only the jobs whose names contain these
 *   node scripts/smoke.mjs --serial    one job at a time
 *   node scripts/smoke.mjs --jobs=8    at most 8 at once
 *
 * Each job's output is kept in `.smoke-logs/<job>.log`, and a failing job's
 * is printed in full at the end. The time each took is kept there too, and
 * the longest start first next time.
